Notes
======
* Caught by this vs that again
* Underscore rocks - Their each methods are much better than my own ones
* key in object : eg. x = {a:'a',b:'b'}, 'a' in x => true, 'd' in x => false 
* x = [] , x instanceof Array => true
* If i can get the same functionality with less code then the less code option should win. This might mean less
  features but the base is more solid.
  
ToDo
=====
* Have a look at what is the fastest way to get stuff into redis. hset or hsetall etc etc ...
